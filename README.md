# Cats Blender Plugin Unofficial Translations.

#### This branch is for Blender 3.6 and 4.0 Translations, As 4.1 cleans up alot of translations in cats please DO NOT use this branch for 4.1 translations. Please note if you make a pull for this branch I will also pull over to the 4.1 branch at a later date to ensure everything is the same.

The non official version of Cats Blender Plugin which is maintained by Yusarina, Cats is an tool designed to shorten steps needed to import and optimize models into VRChat. Compatible models are: MMD, XNALara, Mixamo, Source Engine, Unreal Engine, DAZ/Poser, Blender Rigify, Sims 2, Motion Builder, 3DS Max and potentially more. This repo is for users to help provide translations for the plugin.

See the plugin [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/)

#### How to provide translations?

There are two type of files for Cats there is the translations.csv is for the Cat's UI, then there is the dictionary.json which is cats internal dictionary which help translate shapekeys, bones and etc. 

If you want to contribrute fork the repo, make your edits then put in a pull request.

In the future there will be an option in cats to download the latest translations on github.

#### I have feedback?
